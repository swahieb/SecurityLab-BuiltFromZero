This screenshot captures the session after gaining a reverse shell on the target system as the daemon user. The following observations are noted:

Navigated to /home/robot

Tried to read key-2-of-3.txt:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat key-2-of-3.txt
Result: Permission denied

Able to view password.raw-md5

Confirmed current user and host:

bash
Copy
Edit
whoami && hostname && id
Output: daemon, Linux, and UID/GID confirms daemon user context

This validates the need for privilege escalation to read the second key.
