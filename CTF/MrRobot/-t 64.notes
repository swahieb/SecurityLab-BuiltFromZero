This image shows the continuation of Hydra's brute-force attack on the WordPress login, attempting multiple passwords from the fsocity.dic wordlist using the -t 64 option to increase threads.

Command Context:

bash
Copy
Edit
hydra -l elliot -P fsocity.dic -t 64 10.38.1.111 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In:F=Invalid username"
Highlights:

Multiple valid username/password pairs detected.

Hydra ran with 64 parallel tasks for faster cracking.

Eventually identified ER28-0652 as the correct password.

Shows fsocity.dic had many plausible logins but only one succeeded in logging in.

Takeaway: Thread tuning can significantly speed up brute-force attacks, especially when dealing with large dictionaries.
