This screenshot captures the command used to enumerate SUID binaries on the target system using:

bash
Copy
Edit
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
Among the results, nmap appears with the SUID bit set, which is critical for privilege escalation. It can be used to spawn a shell as root by entering interactive mode with:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap --interactive
!sh
This was the pivot point that allowed escalation from the robot user to full root access.
