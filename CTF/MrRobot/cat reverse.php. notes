This screenshot shows the final part of the custom reverse.php script after editing, with the full reverse shell logic written and saved.

What’s Happening:

Code reads from TCP socket and binds it to process I/O.

Redirects input/output between the remote shell and attacker system.

Script is now ready to be uploaded and triggered via the WordPress theme editor.

Why It’s Important:

Confirms that the reverse shell logic was fully injected.

Ensures the shell can handle input/output over the connection correctly.

Next Step:

Upload this code into 404.php or any accessible PHP file on the target.

Start listener and trigger the payload to get a shell.

Takeaway:
Thorough payload completion is crucial — cutting it short can result in a broken or unstable shell.
