Screenshot: Privilege Escalation to robot User & Nmap Enumeration
This screenshot documents the transition from the daemon user to the robot user and an initial privilege escalation enumeration attempt using nmap.

Key Points:

Attempted to read key-2-of-3.txt as daemon:
Permission denied

Switched to robot user using:

bash
Copy
Edit
su robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Successfully became robot user

Verified user context:

bash
Copy
Edit
whoami && id
Output confirms: robot, UID=1001, GID=1001

Performed SUID binary enumeration:

bash
Copy
Edit
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v "proc"
Confirmed nmap as SUID-enabled:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap --version
This confirms that privilege escalation via nmap may be possible (especially if it supports interactive mode via --interactive).
