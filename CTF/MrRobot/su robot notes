This screenshot illustrates:

Attempt to read key-2-of-3.txt denied under daemon

Found hashed password in password.raw-md5

Echoed hash to file (attempted cracking with rockyou.txt)

Identified that hash corresponds to plaintext abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Switched to robot user with:

bash
Copy
Edit
su robot
Successfully escalated to robot with full shell access

Takeaway:
Recognizing and cracking exposed hashes can lead to vertical privilege escalation, enabling access to previously restricted resources.
