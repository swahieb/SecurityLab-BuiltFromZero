This screenshot captures the moment the reverse shell was successfully established using Netcat (nc -lvp 1234).

Key Evidence:

Connection received from the target machine 10.38.1.111 to attacker's listener.

Shell spawned as user daemon.

Remote system is identified as Ubuntu 3.13.0-55.

Note:

Message /bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off is expected in limited shells.

Indicates basic shell access, good enough to escalate privileges from here.

Takeaway:
Confirms the reverse shell payload worked, and the foothold is established on the target system.
